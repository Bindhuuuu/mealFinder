# Meal Finder Website

Welcome to the Meal Finder website! This application helps you find meal recipes based on the ingredients you have available. Simply enter the ingredients you have, and it will suggest recipes that you can make using those ingredients.

## Features
- **Input Ingredients**: Enter a list of ingredients separated by commas.
- **Find Meals**: The website will display meal suggestions based on the ingredients you entered.
- **Meal Cards**: Each suggestion will show a meal's name, ingredients, recipe instructions, and an image of the meal.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## Demo

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout. A responsive design ensures that the application looks great on any device.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the functionality to filter meals based on the user's input and dynamically updating the UI with meal suggestions.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: 
   - Users input ingredients into a text field (comma-separated).
   - For example: "chicken, tomato, garlic, butter".

2. **Search**:
   - When the user presses the "Find Meals" button, the app will search the predefined list of meals and check which meals can be made using the provided ingredients.

3. **Meal Suggestions**:
   - If any matching meals are found, they are displayed in individual "meal cards" with the meal name, ingredients, recipe, and an image.
   - If no matches are found, a message will notify the user to try again with different ingredients.
